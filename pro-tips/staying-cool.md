# Tips to keep cool in hot weather
These are some tips I collected from co-workers at a previous job during a mini-heatwave here in the UK in 2021. Some of these things will be UK-centric, of course!

Feel free to open a pull request to add any others. 

* Hard to do at work, but useful when trying to sleep: keep. very. still.
* Freeze a 2L bottle of water and place it in front of a fan to get some nice cool(er) air flowing
* At the Tour de France on hot days, they often shove bags of ice down their back
* Wet socks
* Fill a spray bottle with water and spray yourself every so often
* If you have a gel pack which can be heated up or cooled down, put it in the fridge/freezer overnight and wrap it round yourself during the day
* Windows and curtains closed in the day, open at night
* USB-powered evaporative coolers
* A wet handtowel draped over your neck
* We have a mini-air conditioner in my partner's office (with the pipe you stick out the window). With all the blinds closed, it keeps almost the entire house reasonable cool
* Putting sheets in the freezer a bit before sleeping
* Put your head under the shower
* Wet swimming shorts

* Get a washing up bowl of cold water under your desk and soak your feet. No ice needed, just a huge heat sink that can be re-filled easily
* Cold food and drink for breakfast, like overnight oats and cold brew coffee
* Frozen grapes are apparently a great snack
* Make use of silicone baking moulds to make larger ice blocks that will take longer to melt (loaf/cake mould would be good for a foot bath, muffin moulds make great giant ice cubes for drinks)
* Ice/cold flannels on pulse points - wrists, behind knees, neck etc.
* Portable air conditioner in the room I'm working in
* Anti-heat blinds on the windows, blackout blinds closed
* Make use of insulated/double walled water bottles/coffee mugs/cafetieres to keep drinks cool at your desk.
* Solar reflective film to stop the heat getting in the house in the first place (in theory better than blinds/curtains)
* Wet tea towels in the freezer, then draped around my shoulders when I got too hot
* Neck fans
* Work in the bath, with laptop on a plank
* This [2021 Twitter thread with tips for the Pacific North West heatwave](https://twitter.com/ArnicaxRoss/status/1409111943315656710) (US-centric, so might be less relevant or doable for those outside North America)
