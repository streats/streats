## Hi there 👋 I'm Annie or Streats
I’m currently working on the Documentation team at GitHub.

I'm keen to learn more about content and information architecture, system design and storytelling for influence.

Other interests of mine include accessibility, sustainability and climate justice, and the creative and intellectual possibilites of video games and interactive experiences.
