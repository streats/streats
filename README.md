### Hi there 👋 I'm Annie or Streats

* 👩‍💻 I’m currently working on content design for the Education, Communities and Open Source (ECOSS) team at GitHub 
* 🎓 I'm still relatively new to using GitHub, so bear with me as I continue to learn!
* 🌱 I'm keen to learn more about content and information architecture, system design and storytelling for influence
* 🤔 Other interests of mine include accessibility, sustainability and climate justice, and the creative and intellectual possibilites of video games and interactive experiences
