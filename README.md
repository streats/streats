## Hi there 👋 I'm Annie or Streats

👩‍💻 I’m currently working on the Documentation team at GitHub <br>
🎓 I'm still relatively new to using GitHub, so bear with me as I continue to get the hang of how it all works<br>
🌱 I'm keen to learn more about content and information architecture, system design and storytelling for influence.<br>
🤔 Other interests of mine include accessibility, sustainability and climate justice, and the creative and intellectual possibilites of video games and interactive experiences.<br>
